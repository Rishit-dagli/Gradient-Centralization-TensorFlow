# Gradient Centralization TensorFlow

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7%20%7C%203.8%20%7C%203.9-blue)

This Python package implements Gradient Centralization in TensorFlow, a simple and effective optimization technique for 
Deep Neural Networks as suggested by Yong et al. in the paper 
[Gradient Centralization: A New Optimization Technique for Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01461). It can both speedup training 
 process and improve the final generalization performance of DNNs.
